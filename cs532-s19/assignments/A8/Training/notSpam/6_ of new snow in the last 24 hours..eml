Powder Alert
6" in the last 24 hours, and 214" so far this season!
 
Let's face it, Mondays are hard. But with 6" of fresh snow on the ground, you can slash through the Monday blues here at Sugarloaf and take on the real world tomorrow. But on second thought, with forecasts calling for sunshine and temperatures near forty degrees for the next few days, you might just want to cash in some of your hard-earned PTO for a little mountain therapy - no referral necessary.
