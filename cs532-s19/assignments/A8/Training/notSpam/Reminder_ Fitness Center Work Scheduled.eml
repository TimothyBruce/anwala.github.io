REMINDER: Fitness Center Upgrades

 

 

Beginning Wednesday, April 3, painting and repairs will begin in the community Fitness Center. Work will take approximately one week to be completed. Due to the nature of the work, the Fitness Center will have limited hours from Wednesday, April 3 to Wednesday, April 10.

 

The Fitness Center will be closed during the week from 8AM to 5PM. Not to worry! You can still get a workout in, just visit the Fitness Center after 5PM or over the weekend. Repair work will not take place over the weekend, so hours will be 24/7 as usual.

 

 

We appreciate your patience and cooperation!

 

Sincerely,

The Addison at Hampton Team
