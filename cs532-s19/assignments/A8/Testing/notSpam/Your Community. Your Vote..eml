YOUR VOTE MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
 

The Bangor Savings Bank Foundation is offering a simple way for you to show support for your favorite nonprofits during the month of February; and it only takes a few minutes! We are looking to you, our community, to assist us in distributing more than $140,000 to charitable organizations in Maine and New Hampshire.  Last year, we garnered over 70,000 votes from community members who supported nonprofits of all types and sizes by voting in the Bangor Savings Bank Foundation’s Community Matters More grant-making initiative.

A total of 44 grants will be awarded to the organizations listed on the online ballot and to the top 11 write-in recipients. The top two organizations in each of the 11 regions (including write-ins) that get the most votes will receive $5,000 each. The remaining organizations will each receive $1,000. 
 
 

Community Matters More voting takes place during the month of February; beginning February 1 and ending February 28. Winners will be announced in March.

It’s easy to vote for your favorite nonprofits by visiting​ www.bangor.com/cmm.

A complete list of voting guidelines and eligibility requirements for write-in nominations are also available at ​www.bangor.com/cmm.
