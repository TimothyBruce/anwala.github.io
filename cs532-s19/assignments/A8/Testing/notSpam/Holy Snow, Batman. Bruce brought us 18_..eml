Holy snow, Batman. Winter Storm Bruce threw 18" of light and fluffy pow at us today, upping our November snowfall total to over FOUR FEET! Ski Patrol was able to drop ropes on an insane amount of terrain and give you access to 428 acres of powder-filled awesomeness â€“ the most in the East!

So while your Thanksgiving leftovers may be questionable at this point, you can bet that tomorrow's leftover pow will be fresh.
