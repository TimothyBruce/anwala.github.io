This morning’s conditions were incredible. Mother nature refreshed the slopes with a couple inches of fresh snow overnight that smoothed everything back out. Most of the mountain started the day in the clouds but as Skyline chair neared Spillway Crosscut the skies parted revealing a heavenly golden light. Skiers and riders headed up Timberline where the summit sat surrounded by a sea of clouds. Sometimes skiing serves a vehicle for stunning experiences and sometime it’s all about the turns. Fortunately, today delivered on both fronts.
