Assignment #5

(10 points)

1.  We know the result of the Karate Club (Zachary, 1977) split.
Prove or disprove that the result of split could have been predicted
by the weighted graph of social interactions.  How well does the
mathematical model represent reality?

Generously document your answer with all supporting equations, code,
graphs, arguments, etc.

Clues: 
1. Draw original Karate club graph (two connected components) after split (Week 6 lecture, slide 98).
2. Run multiple iterations of graph partioning algorithm (e.g., Girvan-Newman Algorithm) on experimental Karate club graph until the graph splits into two connected components.
3. Compare the connected components of the experimental graph (in 2.) with the original connected components of the split Karate club graph (in 1.). Are they similar?

2.  We know the group split in two different groups.  Suppose the
disagreements in the group were more nuanced -- what would the clubs
look like if they split into groups of 3, 4, and 5?
