Assignment #1
Due: 11:59pm January 31

1.  Demonstrate that you know how to use "curl" well enough to
correctly POST data to a form.  Show that the HTML response that
is returned is "correct".  That is, the server should take the
arguments you POSTed and build a response accordingly.  Save the
HTML response to a file and then view that file in a browser and
take a screen shot.

Feel free to use my simple server for sending POST 
requests: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~anwala/files/temp/namesEcho.php
The server needs you to POST data for "fname" and "lname" fields.

2.  Write a Python program that:
  1. takes as a command line argument a web page
  2. extracts all the links from the page
  3. lists all the links that result in PDF files, and prints out
     the bytes for each of the links.  (note: be sure to follow
     all the redirects until the link terminates with a "200 OK".)
  4. show that the program works on 3 different URIs, one of which
     needs to be:

3.  Consider the "bow-tie" graph in the Broder et al. paper:

    Many have found this link useful: https://www.harding.edu/fmccown/classes/archive/comp475-s13/web-structure-homework.pdf
    Now consider the following graph:

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    C --> A
    C --> G
    E --> F
    G --> C
    G --> H
    I --> H
    I --> K
    L --> D
    M --> A
    M --> N
    N --> D
    O --> A
    P --> G 
    
    For the above graph, give the values for:

    IN: 
    SCC: 
    OUT: 
    Tendrils: 
    Tubes: 
    Disconnected:
